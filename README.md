# fizzbuzz-jest-demo
demo to show how to use jest 

Just to run through and show the format of a unit test using Jest, 
solution in my notes.

we hold our tests in the __tests__ folder 
we "import" the functions by using require, so in this case const fizzBuzz = require("../src/fizzbuzz");

we hold our functions we are testing in our src folder
we export them using module.exports, so in this case module.exports = fizzBuzz;
